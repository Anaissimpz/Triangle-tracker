    <h1>Triangle Tracker.</h1>
    <p>A triangle is an interesting shape that has 3 sides.</p>
    <p>There are different types of triangle and here I am going to talk about 3 of them:</p>
    <h3>Equilateral Triangle.</h3>
    <p>An<strong> equilateral triangle </strong>is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. <br>In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.<br> It is also a regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a <span>regular triangle.</span></p>

    <h3>Isosceles Triangle</h3>
    <p>an isosceles triangle is a triangle with at least two sides of the same length. More precisely, a triangle ABC is said to be isosceles in A when the lengths AB and AC are equal. A is then the main vertex of the triangle and [BC] its base.In an isosceles triangle, the angles adjacent to the base are equal.</p>

    <h3>Scalene Triangle.</h3>
    <p>A scalene Triangle is a triangle which every side is different from one another.</p>
